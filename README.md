# React + Vite
Used some new interactive ways to make a compiler
An in-browser code editor that allows you to write and execute your code in the browser.
Coming up next I might integrate a compiler that has coding questions with some constraints and testcases.

## Run Locally

```bash
# install dependencies

npm install

# start the dev server

npm run dev
```
